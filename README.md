# SeniorProject
This is a senior project with a team comprised of Rodney Chan, Devin Salter,Tony Lei, and Minh Quach. This project will be able to change your desktop background and the color of led light strip(If you have them) by analyzing genre of music. For example, if you are playing classical music, the background will change to a theme that matches classical music. Background pictures selected by the program can be manually set or they can be dynamically generated. There will also be extra features. The dynamic app theme change can change the color of the app itself based off the musical analysis. The visualizer is another tool that shows the sound waves of the song in real time.
